    - **Axios**: For making API calls to interact with the backend.
    - **WebRTC**: For real-time peer-to-peer video calling functionality.

### Backend:
    - **Node.js + Express**: Backend server to handle API requests and manage data.
    - **MongoDB**: Database for storing user profiles, appointments, and video call history.
    - **Socket.IO**: For real-time communication between clients (for video call signaling).
    - **JWT Authentication**: Secure login and user session management.

### Video Calling Services:
    - **WebRTC**: For enabling video/audio communication between users.
    - **Twilio/Agora (Optional)**: For scalable video infrastructure if needed.

### Deployment:
    - **Frontend**: Hosted on Netlify or Vercel for ease of deployment.
    - **Backend**: Deployed on cloud platforms like Heroku, AWS, or DigitalOcean.

## 5. Risks and Solutions

### 1. Integration of Video Calling
    - **Challenge**: Ensuring smooth video call integration with varying browser compatibilities and network issues.
    - **Solution**: Used WebRTC and Socket.IO for signaling, and provided fallback mechanisms for unsupported browsers. Implemented auto-reconnect and notifications for connection issues.

### 2. Scalability of Video Calls
    - **Challenge**: As the platform grows, video calls might strain the backend infrastructure.
    - **Solution**: Used Twilio or Agora (if needed) for scalable video infrastructure, allowing seamless scaling without impacting performance.

### 3. Data Privacy and Security
    - **Challenge**: Ensuring secure and private video consultations to comply with healthcare regulations (e.g., HIPAA).
    - **Solution**: Implemented end-to-end encryption for all video/audio calls. All data is stored securely and compliant with data privacy regulations.

### 4. User Adoption of Video Calling
    - **Challenge**: Some patients or doctors may not be familiar with video calling.
    - **Solution**: Simplified the UI/UX for easy navigation and provided tutorials on how to set up and use video calling.

### 5. Network Issues
    - **Challenge**: Video quality can be impacted by poor internet connections.
    - **Solution**: Included an audio-only mode and an auto-reconnect feature to ensure the call remains active in case of network instability.

## 6. Conclusion
    AmedicK provides a comprehensive solution to the challenges patients and healthcare providers face when trying to access medical care. By offering online appointment booking and video calling for premium users, AmedicK creates a seamless experience for both patients and doctors, improving accessibility and convenience.
